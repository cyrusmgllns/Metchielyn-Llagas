                    <p>I believe that traveling helps broaden one’s perspective and leads to a better understanding of both the world and oneself. Hi, my name is Metchielyn Llagas, daughter of Nestor O. Llagas and Menchie Llagas. We are 8 in the family consists of my parents, my older sister, my older brother, me and my three younger sisters and let me give you a tour of my life, I am just a normal student with a lot of dreams, and one of these is to travel, but I am also aware that I have priorities, which is why I did both. I study while I travel. I was born in the hidden paradise in the province of Quezon on Alabat Island where I took my primary and secondary school where my dream began, I used to play safe and stay where I thought I belonged but then my curiosity widened, and I wanted to go out on my comfort zone, and explore places outside our island. So, I decided to set aside my fears and travel for the first time, going to Tanay, Rizal where I took my senior high school, and then travel to different places like in Baguio, Olongapo, Pampanga, Laguna, Pangasinan, Cavite, and many more, where I enjoyed and know myself more, I become more confident and learn to express myself more. I’m currently taking my bachelor's here in Marikina, then from time to time I travel to Batangas, Mindoro and even explore Manila when I have free time. Doing these I get to enjoy and learn at the same time, coz I do believe that while we are young let's travel and explore because money will come back our time won't.</p>
